Gann considered the 45 degrees line the most important line, where the market has some form of balance. Prices above the 45 degrees line indicate an uptrend, where below - a downtrend. During an uptrend, prices will find resistance at the lines above the 45 degrees line. When prices break below the 45 degrees line, then a possible reversal may be expected. Consequently, prices are expected to find support at the lines below the 45 degrees line.

Gann considered the 45 degrees line as the most important in representing long-term trendlines. Based on Gann’s theory, prices: above the ascending 45 degrees line indicate an uptrend. Further acceleration of the upward movement may find resistance at the higher 45 degrees lines. below the ascending line imply possible change in trend direction. Further fall of the prices may find support at the lower 45 degrees lines. below the descending 45 degrees line, indicate a downtrend.

According to Gann’s theory, prices: above the ascending 45 degrees line indicates a strong upwards movement. below the ascending line implies a possible change in trend direction. below the descending 45 degrees line indicate a strong downwards movement. above the descending line implies a possible change in trend direction. on the 45 degrees line shows a market in balance i.e. one unit of price corresponds to one unit of time."

There are two types of Candlestick; the first Candle has a white or hollow body which indicates that the market is moving upwards, as there is more buying than selling interest. As the Close price is higher than the Open price, the white candlestick depicts the positive sentiment in the market and the fact that bulls are in control. The longer the body is, the stronger the buying interest. A filled (black) body indicates that the market is moving downwards, as there is more selling than buying interest. As the Close price is lower than the Open price, the black candlestick depicts the negative sentiment in the market and the fact that bears are in control. The longer the body is, the stronger the selling interest. The lines above and below the body of the candlestick are called “Shadows” or “Wicks”.

The %R indicator often anticipates reversals as it forms a top and turns down before the underlying financial instrument does and similarly, it forms a bottom and turns up before the price does. To calculate %R, take the difference between the Highest High of the last n periods and the current closing price - this is the dividend. Furthermore, take the difference between the Highest High of the last n periods and the Lowest Low of the last n periods - this is the divisor. Finally, multiply the quotient by -100."
