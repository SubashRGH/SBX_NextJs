                The high degree of leverage associated with these types of

                financial products is higher. Leverage (or Margin trading) may
                work against you resulting in a substantial loss as well as a
                substantial gain.

                Trading on Margin involves a high level of risk and is not

                against you, as well as for you. It is your sole responsibility
                to monitor your open positions and you should monitor them

                offered by us, please seek independent financial advice. There

                    CFDs IN GENERAL
                  </h3>
                  <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    CFDs are complex financial derivative products which
                    generally only close when a client chooses to close an
                    existing open position, and therefore generally have no set
                    maturity date. (This can be subject to change depending on
                    the terms of the underlying asset className and or product).
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    CFDs can be likened to futures contracts, which can be
                    entered into in relation to certain foreign currencies,
                    indices, precious metals, oil, commodities, or other
                    financial instruments. However, unlike other futures, CFD
                    contracts can only be settled in cash. Transactions in CFDs
                    may also have a contingent liability and you should be aware
                    of the implications of this as set out below. All our CFDs
                    are synthetic contracts, which means that clients do not
                    have any right to the underlying instrument or thing or the
                    rights which are attached to the same unless specifically
                    stated in the CFD. This includes no right to any underlying
                    reference shares or attached voting rights.

                  <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    CFDs relating to foreign markets involve different risks
                    from the clientâ€™s native markets. In some cases, risks will
                    be greater. The potential for profit or loss from
                    transactions relating to foreign markets will be affected by
                    fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Such enhanced risks
                    include the risks of political or economic policy charges in
                    a foreign jurisdiction, which may substantially and
                    permanently alter the conditions, terms, marketability, or
                    price of a foreign currency.

                    impossible to execute such orders at the required prices or
                    at all. Should a client trade using such orders or strategy
                    they must do so accepting this risk.

                  <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    CFDs carry a high degree of risk. The gearing and leverage
                    that is obtainable with CFD trading means that you only need
                    to place a small deposit (Margin) to commence trading with
                    us although this small deposit may result in large losses or
                    large gains. Highly leveraged transactions are subject to
                    significant changes in value because of relatively small
                    changes in the value or level of the underlying instrument
                    or thing on which the price of the CFD is based.

                  <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    CFDs are leveraged or margined transactions requiring you to
                    make a series of payments against the contract value,
                    instead of paying the entire contract value immediately. You
                    may sustain a total loss of the Margin you deposit with us
                    to establish or maintain a position. We re-value your open
                    positions continuously during each business day, and any
                    profit or loss is immediately reflected in your account and
                    a loss may result in you being called upon to pay
                    substantial additional Margin on short notice to maintain
                    your open positions.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-base font-light leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    We may change the rates of Margin and/or notional trading
                    requirements at any time (including over weekends/bank
                    holidays or in abnormal market conditions), which may also
                    result in a change to the Margin you are required to
                    maintain. If you do not maintain sufficient Margin on your
                    account at all times and/or provide such additional funds
                    within the time required, your open positions may be closed
                    at a loss, and you may be liable for any resulting deficit.

                    us, in respect of the underlying financial instrument or
                    thing on which the price of the CFD is based. All open
                    positions with us must be closed with us and cannot be
                    closed with any other party. This may make it difficult for
                    you to close a position at a price that you are happy with
                    or at all (for example, if we experience technical problems
                    with our Online Platform and it is unavailable, or we become

                    Trading in OTC financial transactions may expose you to
                    greater risks than trading on a regulated market because
                    there is no market on which to close out your open positions
                    and prices and other conditions are set by us subject to any
                    legal/regulatory requirements. OTC transactions may increase
                    the liquidity risk and introduce other significant risk
                    factors: it may be impossible, for example, to assess the
                    value of a position resulting from an OTC transaction or to
                    determine the risk exposure. Also, bid prices and offer
                    prices need not be quoted by us and, even where they are, we
                    may find it difficult to establish a fair price particularly
                    when the relevant exchange or market for the underlying is
                    closed or suspended. You are also exposed to the risk of our
                    default.

                    The prices posted on our Online Platform may not necessarily

                    other participants in the Reference Market. Consequently, we
                    may exercise considerable discretion in setting Margin
                    requirements and collecting Margin from you. As the CFDs are
                    in part related to the underlying (and any Reference
                    Market), you should ensure you are aware of the risks
                    involved in the underlying including currency fluctuation,
                    volatility, and gapping (a sudden price shift which can be
                    caused by many factors including but not exclusively,
                    economic events, market announcements and periods where
