This bank has so far maintained this view despite the fact that energy prices have been on a downward trend in recent months as the Chinese government eased its Zero Covid policy and the stagnation of the world economy restrains consumption demand. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/Knowledge_Articles_Image2.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"mb-7\"> (Commodity market volatility in 2022. Source: TradingView) </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> The bank expects the S&P GSCI Total Return Index, a leading measure of commodity price volatility, to grow 43% in 2023. That increase would add up to a 24% gain so far this year 2022. In contrast, US stocks will fall about 16%, and government bonds will also fall. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> In a report published on December 14, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote: “Although prices of many commodities have increased by nearly twice year-on-year to May 2022, the cost of capital across the commodity sector remains at disappointing levels. This is the most important revelation of 2022: the unusually high price of goods at the beginning of this year also did not create an incentive for businesses to spend large enough capital into this industry, so the supply will also not be enough to address the long-term shortage”. </p> <h1 class=\"font-color text-xl mb-3\">Supply will become an issue</h1> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Goldman Sachs isn't the only one to be bullish on commodities. Many experts and investors believe that the lack of exploration for new oil fields as well as investment in mineral fields will cause commodity reserves to dry up and supply in the market to become limited. The top 15 commodity-focused hedge funds have increased their assets by 50% this year to $20.7 billion, according to preliminary data from Bridge Alternative Investments Inc. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Goldman Sachs analysts said: “Without enough capital invested to create a back-up, the commodity market will remain stuck in shortages for a long time, prices will be higher and more volatile.” </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/Knowledge_Articles_Image3.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> The bank forecasts Brent crude will rise to $105/barrel in the fourth quarter of 2023, up from $82 currently. Copper price will also jump to 10,050 USD/ton from around 8,400 USD currently. The price of liquefied natural gas in Asia will increase from 33 USD/mBtu to 53.1 USD. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> However, some other analysts are skeptical and say economies are too fragile to withstand another rally in commodity prices. As the situation may be changing and the risk of a global recession will pose a threat to an asset class that has experienced a period of recovery over the past two years. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\">Reference: Bloomberg</p> <div class=\"mt-16\"> <button class=\"rounded-full cmn-btn mb-5\"> <a href=\"/trade/knowledge-articles\"> Read more Articles </a> </button> </div>",

Then, in June, the world's largest cryptocurrency lending and borrowing platform Celsius (USA) froze customer assets, reporting a loss of $1.2 billion when declaring bankruptcy. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Singapore-based crypto investment fund Three Arrows Capital also met the same fate in the same month. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies fell in tandem, dropping more than 50% in value in just 49 days since the end of May. </p> <h1 class=\"font-color text-xl mb-3\">Supply will become an issue</h1> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Also within a single day in June, the value of Bitcoin fell by about 15%, which is considered the worst day for this cryptocurrency since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic rocked the financial markets. </p> <h1 class=\"font-color text-xl mb-3\">The shock at the end of 2022</h1> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Following that, arguably the biggest shock in the cryptocurrency market this year was the collapse of FTX, one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, in November. The value of Bitcoin has dropped by about 25% in less than 4 days. Currently Bitcoin is priced at about 16,000 USD/Bitcoin. Overall, 2022 is almost a \"catastrophic\" year for the cryptocurrency market. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/crypto/crypto-3.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> However, there is still a bright spot in this year's cryptocurrency market that the Ethereum blockchain platform has been upgraded, thereby drastically reducing energy consumption, 99.95% less than the previous version. According to research firm Digiconomist, before the software upgrade, a single transaction on Ethereum consumed as much electricity as the average US household consumes in a week. </p><p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\">Reference: TTXVN</p> <div class=\"mt-16\"> <button class=\"rounded-full cmn-btn mb-5\"> <a href=\"/trade/knowledge-articles\"> Read more Articles </a> </button> </div>",

The plunge took place in the context that the world had nearly 300 interest rate hikes. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> The year 2022 is full of shocks that turn everything upside down: the war in Ukraine, the story of soaring inflation as the world steps out of the epidemic world (except for China) and the wave of raising interest rates around the globe. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> US and German government bonds – two benchmarks for the global bond market and often sought-after assets in times of uncertainty – also lost 16% and 24%. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/reversed/reversed-2.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> The tragic story began to unfold as soon as the most influential central bank in the world, the Fed, was fierce about raising interest rates. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Yields on 10-year US government bonds rose from less than 1.5% to 1.8% in January 2022, sending the MSCI world stock index down 5%. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Currently, the 10-year US government bond yield is at 3.68%, the world stock index fell 20%, and the oil price jumped 80% before cooling down. The Fed raised rates by 400 basis points, the European Central Bank by 250 basis points, although last year they said it was unlikely to raise rates. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> In emerging markets, Turkey's high inflation and monetary policy anomalies sent the lira down 28%. However, the country's stock market is the best performer in the world. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> The country in turmoil, Egypt, has devalued its currency by more than 36%. Ghana's Cedi plunged 60% on default along with Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, the Russian ruble is the world's second-best performer, thanks in part to Moscow's capital controls. At first, the ruble depreciated sharply because of the war in Ukraine. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/reversed/reversed-3.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"mb-7\">(Performance of world currencies against USD)</p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> “If you ask me what will happen next year, I don't know what to tell you,” said Robert Alster, chief investment officer at Close Brothers Asset Management. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> In the UK, financial markets were constantly facing ups and downs, with the pound and British bonds plummeting during the time of former Prime Minister Liz Truss in power. </p><p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Yields on 10-year UK government bonds rose more than 100 basis points and sterling lost 9% in just a few days. This level of volatility is rare in developed markets. </p><p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Tech Stocks Trouble The increase in interest rates also \"blows\" 3.6 trillion USD from the capitalization of technology giants. Shares of Facebook and Tesla both fell more than 60%, while Alphabet and Amazon t fell 40% and 50% respectively. </p><p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Chinese stocks have just rebounded strongly thanks to signs of easing measures to control Zero COVID. However, the country's stocks are still down 25% in 2022. </p><img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/reversed/reversed-4.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> IPOs and bond sales also fell sharply in nearly every country (except the Middle East), while commodities were the best performing asset class for the second year in a row. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Natural gas prices rose more than 50%, the best-performing asset in 2022, thanks in part to supply disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war. At one point, the price of natural gas increased by more than 140%. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Increasing recession fears, coupled with the West's plan to stop buying Russian oil, have caused Brent oil prices to return 80% of their gains in the first quarter of 2022. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/reversed/reversed-5.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Stefan Gerlach, Chief Economist at EFG and former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, said: “What has happened in global markets this year is traumatic.

However, the market has recovered and gold has gained about $200 since November on expectations that the US Federal Reserve will slow down the pace of interest rate hikes. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/gold/gold23.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"mb-7\"> (Commodity market volatility in 2022. Source: TradingView) </p> <h1 class=\"font-color text-xl mb-3\">Outlook in 2023</h1> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> In the 2023 outlook, analysts and research firms are bullish on gold as they expect the US Federal Reserve's (Fed) monetary policy to peak, inflation to remain high and global economic uncertainty will support prices in the new year. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> The price of gold in 2023 will depend on the monetary policy of the Fed and its impact on the trajectory of the USD. With the backdrop of increased uncertainty in 2023 and a dovish Fed, the dollar weakening, safe-haven demand for gold will increase. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/gold/gold1.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"mb-7\"> (Chart records Fed officials' rate projections, source: Bloomberg) </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Currently, markets are expecting the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to a peak between 5.00% and 5.25% in the first half of this year. And many investors in the market expect the Fed to begin lowering interest rates later this year or early 2024. Higher interest rates will increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion and will support the USD, which fluctuates against gold. </p> <h1 class=\"font-color text-xl mb-3\"> USD Index drops after peaking at 114.73 points </h1> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> The dollar strengthened as the Fed began the process of raising interest rates in early 2022. After five rate hikes, the Fed's target rate range now rises to 4.25%-4.5%, the highest level in 15 years since December 2007. However, the market has become more optimistic when investors expect the US Federal Reserve to slow down the pace of interest rate hikes this year. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/gold/gold2.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"mb-7\"> (USD index chart over the past year, source: Stockbanx) </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> On the USD index chart, on 11/11/2022, the market fell sharply and broke the 107.65 point support created the previous September. At the same time, the index also confirmed the short-term downtrend with resistance at 105.64 points. It is expected that with the Fed will continue to raise interest rates until mid-2023, the USD index will recover to the range of 108-110.00 value points. However, under the pressure of the Fed to lower interest rates at the end of the year, the USD index may drop to the zone of 97-94.61 points, returning to the bottom level created from the first day of 2022. </p> <h1 class=\"font-color text-xl mb-3\">Gold price recovered strongly</h1> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Gold prices fell sharply from a peak of 2070 USD/oz as the conflict in Russia and Ukraine broke out, creating a chain of uncertain events on the global economy. However, up to now, the gold price has recovered more than 60% since the low of 1614 USD/oz on 9/15/2022. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/gold/gold4.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <p class=\"mb-7\"> (Gold price chart over the past year, source: Stockbanx) </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> With the current recovery momentum, the market can continue to move towards the $2000-2070 resistance area created around March 2022 and possibly even higher. The biggest risk to gold's bullish outlook in 2023 is the threat of prolonged inflation, which experts say will force the US central bank to maintain tight monetary policies. That will be detrimental to the gold price. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> But some positives came in the early days of 2023, when the Fed's December 2022 policy meeting admitted it had made \"significant progress\" over the past year in raising interest rates enough to bring down inflation. And at its first rate hike meeting this year on January 31 to February 01, 2023, the Fed is expected to raise only 25 basis points, a significant improvement from last year. And this will create more positive signals for gold in 2023. </p> <h1 class=\"font-color text-xl mb-3\"> Trade Gold with Stockbanx and get the 2023 New Year cashback offer up to 20,000 USD </h1> <h1 class=\"font-color text-xl mb-3\"> For details, please refer to: <a href=\"https://campaign.cptinternational.com/lunar-en/\" target=\"_blank\" >https://campaign.cptinternational.com/lunar-en/ </a> </h1> <div class=\"mt-16\"> <button class=\"rounded-full cmn-btn mb-5\"> <a href=\"/trade/market-overview\"> Read more Articles </a> </button> </div>",

In the midst of earnings season for the most influential segment of the US stock market, technology stocks led the way higher. They are the companies with the largest market capitalizations. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Names like Microsoft, Intel, and Tesla will release their fourth-quarter results this week, which will set the course of the industry in a sector that has faced a significant downward adjustment due to interest rate increases throughout 2022. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> This negative sentiment has been fading in recent weeks as technology companies shift their focus to cost-cutting and inflation shows signs of easing, causing market interest rates to fall significantly. The yield on the 10-year US Treasury note remained around 3.52% yesterday. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> The Nasdaq technological index rose more than 2% yesterday, breaking the downward trend line that has been in place since the fall of 2022. This is a bullish technical signal that, if confirmed by a weekly close at these levels or higher, will pave the way for larger gains in the near future. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> For this to happen, the earnings of the tech companies that make up the Nasdaq 100 must not disappoint, and the Federal Reserve's recent shift towards a more dovish bias should be confirmed at the next meeting. Currently, the market expects a rate increase of only 25 basis points. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> China's reopening after a long period of COVID-Zero policy is another thing that is making people feel better about the market. The elements that contributed the most to the uncertainty in the market and the rise in inflation, such as the bottlenecks in the supply chains (largely due to the closure of activity in China) and the extraordinary surge in raw material prices, have been corrected. </p> <p class=\"text-base read-font mb-6\"> Natural gas was one of the commodities that caused the most concern, especially in Europe. Following the extraordinary rally caused by the conflict in Ukraine, natural gas has corrected downward and is now trading at levels similar to those of 2020. Technically, it has broken the support at $3.35 and is making its way to falling below $3. </p> <img src=\"https://file.cptinternational.com/Unified/News/nasdaq/nasdaq-2.svg\" alt=\"news\" class=\"mb-6\" /> <div class=\"mt-16\"> <button class=\"rounded-full cmn-btn mb-5\"> <a href=\"/trade/market-overview\"> Read more Articles </a> </button> </div>",
